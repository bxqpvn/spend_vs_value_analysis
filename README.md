# Spend vs Value Analysis with Python

In this notebook, I carried out an analysis to explore the relationship between total spending and total value. The process involved importing the dataset, performing data manipulations, calculating key metrics, and visualizing the results through plots.
- I began by importing the dataset using pandas and loading it into a DataFrame. After that, I inspected the data structure, cleaned it where necessary, and used functions like groupby() and mean() to summarize and extract meaningful insights from the data.
- To visually explore the relationship between the variables, I used seaborn and matplotlib to create various plots. The key visualization was a linear regression plot created with lmplot() to illustrate the correlation between total spend and total value. I customized the chart with labels, a grid, and a legend to enhance readability.
